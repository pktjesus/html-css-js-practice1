# AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a **frontend learning repository** for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals (html-css-js-practice1). It serves as a practice workspace for building foundational web development skills.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Basic starter template ("Hello, World!")
- `html-basic.html` - HTML practice file with semantic structure and Korean content
- `my_photo.jpg` - Sample image asset
- `README.md` - Project metadata

## Key Patterns & Conventions

### HTML Structure
- **Language & Encoding**: Files use `lang="en"` and `UTF-8` charset
- **Meta Tags**: Include viewport for responsive design and optional author/description metadata
- **Semantic Sections**: Use `<section>` with descriptive classes for grouping related content
- **Content Style**: Korean text is commonly used in examples (e.g., fruit lists, author names)

### File Naming
- HTML files use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `html-basic.html`)
- Asset files follow standard naming (e.g., `my_photo.jpg`)

## Development Workflow

**View & Test**: Open `.html` files directly in a browser to preview changes immediately. No build process required.

## Important Guidelines for Agents

1. **Preserve Semantic HTML**: Use semantic elements (`<section>`, `<article>`, etc.) over generic `<div>` when structuring content
2. **Accessibility First**: Include proper `lang` attributes and meta tags in all new HTML files
3. **Korean Content Support**: Files may contain Korean text; ensure UTF-8 encoding is always preserved
4. **Responsive Design**: Include viewport meta tag in all HTML files: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
5. **Practice-First Mindset**: This is a learning repository—code examples should be clear and educational rather than production-optimized

## Common Tasks

- **Creating new HTML practice files**: Start with the structure from `index.html` or `html-basic.html` as templates
- **Adding new sections**: Use `<section>` with a class name and semantic heading hierarchy
- **Listing content**: Use `<ul>/<li>` for unordered lists; apply classes for styling
